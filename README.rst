dympy
=====

A tool to communicate with Dymola from python on Windows
dympy communicates with dymola through DDE (Dynamic Data Exchange).
After a connection with an open Dymola window is established, commands can be sent as if they were typed in the Dymola command line.
Several usefull commands (opening models, setting model parameters, compiling, writing a dsin.txt file, simulating, and loading results,...) have been predefined for ease of use.

Check the example below for a quickstart or the docstrings for a more complete guide.

Installation
------------
requires:

- ``numpy``
- ``scipy``
- ``pywin32-214`` available on `sourceforge <https://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/files/pywin32/Build%20214/>`_.

To install, first install ``pywin32-214`` for your system then run::

	pip install dympy


Example
-------

First initialize the Dymola connection. It is good practice to clear all open models from Dymola after initialization to avoid redefinition conflicts, however this is not necessary::

	dymola = dympy.Dymola()
	dymola.clear()

Next we'll open a model and compile it::

	dymola.openModel('example.mo')
	dymola.compile('example')

Parameters can be changed using the ``set_parameters`` method. The method takes a dictionary with name, value pairs as input.
Inputs can be written to a dsu.txt file  using the ``write_dsu`` method. The method again takes a dictionary with name, value pairs as input, ``time`` must always be one of the inputs::

	dymola.set_parameters({'C_in.C':5e6,'C_em.C':10e6,'UA_em_in.G':1600,'UA_in_amb.G':200})
	dymola.set_parameters({'C_em.T':300})
	dymola.write_dsu({'time':[0,43200,86400],'Q_flow_hp':[1000,5000,2000],'T_amb':[273.15,278.15,273.15]})


The simulation can now be started within a certain time range::

	dymola.simulate(StopTime=86400)


After the simulation is finished you can load the results as a dictionary using ``get_result()``.
The result is a dictionary with the variable names in dot notation as keys::

	res = dymola.get_result()
	print(res.keys())

There is also a ``get_res`` method implemented which will return all result keys which are children of the supplied argument key.
If the argument has no children it's value is returned::

	dymola.get_res('UA_em_in')
